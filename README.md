# catastro-angular
Catastro front-end builded with Angular 5 and Materialize. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Configuration
As an Angular CLI project the `src/environment folder includes the configuration files for development and production, uses this files to define the url to the API or the Google Maps API key.
The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead. The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `.angular-cli.json`.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
